# Durrr(ability)

*Because everyone has had that Durrr moment and forgot to repair when we're able to.*

The aim of Durrr(ability) is to give you the ability to see when your stuff's borked.

If you have an LDB display like [ChocolateBar](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/chocolatebar) or [TitanPanel](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/titan-panel) this will automatically place itself in your display.  Otherwise, it's just a minimap button that you can move around the minimap or hide completely if you want to.

**Features**
* Auto-Updating percentage display on your chosen LDB Display
* Show just the average percentage, or each item individually
* Choose to figure in the equipment in your bags into the average percentage or not
* Auto Repair
  * Choose to use Guild Funds (*If Available*)
    * Choose to use *ONLY* Guild Funds (*If Available*)
  * Choose whether or not to auto-repair based on your current reputation with a particular vendors
* Choose to have a Repair Warning pop up when you enter a "Rested" state (usually a city)
  * Set the threshold where this warning fires
* Choose to have a Repair Warning pop up when your durability falls below a threshold that you set
  * Set the threshold where this warning fires

# Durrr(ability)
*Because everyone has had that Durrr moment and forgot to repair when we're able to.*
If you have an LDB display like [ChocolateBar](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/chocolatebar) or [TitanPanel](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/titan-panel) this will automatically place itself in your display.  Otherwise, it's just a minimap button that you can move around the minimap or hide completely if you want to.

## Durrr(ability) is here to see how borked your stuff is, and remind you to repair.
This began as a fork of [Broker_DurabilityInfo](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/broker_durabilityinfo) in the Battle for Azeroth expansion as the addon had not yet been updated at that time, and over time I added features to it that I thought were missing and should be there.  Unfortunately, due to Shadowlands being less than stellar, I stepped away from the game and let my addons fall short.

I am now back for Dragonflight (and beyond?) and while credits go to [FulgerTunet](https://www.curseforge.com/members/fulgertunet) for his addon, I am updating and continuing to work on adding features to this as time goes on. If you don't need the additional features I've added, I highly suggest you look at using [Broker_DurabilityInfo](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/broker_durabilityinfo) as it too has been updated for Dragonflight.
